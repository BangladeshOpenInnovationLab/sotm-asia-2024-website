<h2 id='Bangladesh'>Bangladesh</h2>

Bangladesh is a country state in Southern Asia (converging with Southeast Asia), bordering the Bay of Bengal to the South, almost entirely encircled by India to the West North and East, and Myanmar to the Southeast. Although off the beaten path by virtually any measurement, Bangladesh is populated by friendly locals.

<h2 id='Coxs Bazar'>Cox's Bazar</h2>

Cox's Bazar, unquestionably the most renowned destination in Bangladesh, is famous for its stunning scenery and vibrant local culture. It not only serves as a venue but also offers an immersive experience that enriches the ambience and allure of events like State of the Map Asia. The serene and picturesque beach vista will serve as an optimal venue for an event focused on fostering connections and forging lasting memories. The unique geographical features of Cox's Bazar, including its coastal and marine ecosystems, make it an excellent subject for discussions on geospatial analysis and mapping. The inclusion of this relevance can enhance the conference's content by offering concrete illustrations of how geospatial technology can be utilized in coastal management, environmental conservation, and mitigating the risks of climate change-induced disasters. Due to its significance as a crucial location for environmental and humanitarian efforts, Cox's Bazar is already a central hub for numerous international NGOs and agencies. This is primarily due to the presence of one of the largest refugee camps globally and the area's susceptibility to climate-related challenges. By hosting an event like "State of the Map" here, we can take advantage of this attention to improve opportunities for creative solutions through the use of mapping and spatial analysis, as well as international collaboration. Overall, Cox's Bazar not only provides a scenic backdrop for State of the Map Asia 2024 but also aligns closely with the thematic needs of the event, making it a strategic choice to foster engagement, discussion, and potential solutions for local and global challenges through geospatial technology. Whether you are a local resident or a visitor from afar, this event promises an enriching experience that showcases the best of what Cox's Bazar and Bangladesh have to offer.

<h2 id='transportation'>Public transportation</h2>
The proposed venue is in the main hotel motel zone, making it within walking distance from any of the accommodations within the city. One can easily use the footpaths, beachways, and marine drives to get to the venue. The common and necessary local transportation options include CNG (tuk-tuks), rickshaws, and TomToms (electric buggies), which are particularly popular with tourists because of their accessibility and convenience. Bicycle and bike rental services are now also available in the city, but they are more to be used for exploring the picturesque marine drive and the different beaches throughout the coast.
